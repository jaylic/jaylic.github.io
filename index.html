      <p><em><strong>Hello World!</strong></em> Yes, that's my name, no need for further introduction. <em>But what do you do?</em> you ask?
       Well, lots of things lately, <strong>but not nearly enough of them.</strong> The coffee maker <strong>broke</strong>, nearly caught
        on <em>fire</em>, nearly <em>melted</em>, and now <strong>I'm stuck making coffee in the old-fashioned pour-over method.</strong> 
        It'll do for now, at least until the post office delivers the new coffeemaker that <strong>UPS TELLS ME HAS BEEN DELIVERED ALREADY.
      </strong> <em>What's going on there???</em>

      <h2>I'm a freelance photographer. Need some photos, Thoughtbot? Of course you do. Why?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Because selfies don't cut it on a professional's level</li>
        <li>Because you're all so damn good-looking, it would be a pleasure</li>
        <li>Because nepotism</li>
